# Apartment-Manager
This is the project of Fundamentals of Programmming Course (Python - Fall 2020) that was instructed by Alireza Kadivar.
Developed by Sepehr Harfi, Mahdie Shahabipoor, Hannaneh Malakooti.
We made some tools to help someone manage their apartment's bills by calculating each unit's share and drawing some plots for visualization.
